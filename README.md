## Changelog

See the changelog [here](https://github.com/Antyos/vscode-mlog/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## Contributing

I made this extension because I like OpenSCAD and there wasn't any language support in VS Code I liked. I will try and keep this extension up to date in the future, but I make no promises.

If you would like to contribute, here's what you can do:

1. Fork the repository: <https://github.com/Antyos/vscode-mlog.git>
2. Run `npm install` to download node modules
3. Rename `.vscode/launch-template.json` to `.vscode/launch.json`
4. Make changes
5. Submit a pull request!
